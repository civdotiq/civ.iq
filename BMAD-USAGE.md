# BMad Method - Selective Integration Guide for civic-intel-hub

## ✅ Successfully Installed Components

### 1. Codebase Flattener (RECOMMENDED TO USE)

The most immediately useful feature for your workflow.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Flatten your codebase for AI context sharing
npx bmad-method flatten

# This creates a single XML file perfect for sharing with Claude/ChatGPT
# Output: bmad-core/flattened-code.xml
```

### 2. QA Agent Prompts (USEFUL)

Located in: `bmad-core/agents/qa-engineer.md`

These prompts can enhance your existing testing workflow:

- Comprehensive test planning
- Edge case identification
- Performance testing strategies

### 3. Story Templates (USE AS NEEDED)

Located in: `bmad-core/workflow/`

For complex features, you can use BMad's story structure:

1. Create detailed story in `bmad-core/stories/1-todo/`
2. Move to `2-doing/` when implementing
3. Archive in `3-done/` when complete

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow Integration

### For Daily Development (Keep Current Workflow)

Continue using your CLAUDE.md approach:

- 30-line validation rule
- OODA debugging framework
- Incremental commits

### For Complex Features (Use BMad Selectively)

1. **Planning Phase**: Use BMad's architect agent for complex architectural decisions
2. **Context Sharing**: Use flattener when you need to share large context with AI
3. **QA Enhancement**: Reference QA agent prompts for comprehensive testing

## 📝 Your Current Workflow Remains Primary

Your CLAUDE.md file and established patterns take precedence. BMad tools are additive helpers, not replacements.

## 🔧 Quick Commands

```bash
# Flatten codebase for AI
npx bmad-method flatten

# Check BMad version
npx bmad-method --version

# Update BMad (when needed)
npx bmad-method install
```

## ⚠️ What NOT to Use (Yet)

These BMad features conflict with your current workflow:

- Full agent workflow (stick with CLAUDE.md)
- Automated story generation (your incremental approach is better for this project)
- Web-based planning tools (your current IDE-based flow is more efficient)

## Next Steps

1. Try the codebase flattener: `npx bmad-method flatten`
2. Review QA agent prompts for testing ideas
3. Continue with your normal development workflow
4. Use BMad features only when they add clear value
