It has jurisdiction over all discretionary spending legislation in the Senate.\n\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee is the largest committee in the U.S. Senate, with 30 members in the 117th Congress. Its role is defined by the U.S. Constitution, which requires \"appropriations made by law\" prior to the expenditure of any money from the Treasury, and the committee is therefore one of the most powerful committees in the Senate.[1] The committee was first organized on March 6, 1867, when power over appropriations was taken out of the hands of the Finance Committee.[2]\nThe chair of the Appropriations Committee has enormous power to bring home special projects (sometimes referred to as \"pork barrel spending\") for their state as well as having the final say on other senators' appropriation requests.[3] For example, in fiscal year 2005, per capita federal spending in Alaska, the home state of Chair Ted Stevens, was $12,000, double the national average. Alaska has 11,772 special earmarked projects for a combined cost of $15,780,623,000. This represents about four percent of the overall spending in the $388 billion Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 passed by Congress.[4]\nFrom 2001 to 2021, every Senate Majority Leader was a previous or concurrently serving member of the Appropriations Committee: Tom Daschle (committee member, 1991–1999; majority leader, 2001–2003), Bill Frist (committee member, 1995–2002; majority leader, 2003–2007), Harry Reid (committee member, 1989–2006; majority leader, 2007–2015), and Mitch McConnell (current committee member; majority leader, 2015–2021).\n\n",

Cheatle (born 1970 or 1971) is an American former law enforcement officer who served as the 27th director of the United States Secret Service from 2022 until 2024. After serving in the Secret Service from 1995 to 2019, she worked as senior director of global security at PepsiCo from 2019 to 2022. Appointed director of the Secret Service by President Joe Biden, she assumed the office on 17 September 2022, becoming the second woman to hold the position.\nFollowing the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a campaign rally on July 13, 2024, the Secret Service was widely criticized over security lapses. On July 22, Cheatle testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, where she faced bipartisan calls for her resignation. She resigned on July 23 and was succeeded by acting director Ronald L. Rowe Jr.",
