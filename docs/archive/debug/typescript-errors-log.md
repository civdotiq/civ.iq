## TypeScript Errors Found During Step 2.6 Verification

The following TypeScript compilation errors were identified:

1. **SimpleClientWrapper Props Issue** (simple/page.tsx:48) - Missing initialData prop type
2. **DistrictMap Props Issue** (results/page.tsx:1138) - Missing zipCode prop type
3. **VotingTab Variables** (VotingTab.tsx:553+) - Undefined pagination variables
4. **Unused Directive** (MBTilesService.ts:68) - Unused @ts-expect-error

These appear to be related to the component co-location effort and need to be addressed in a follow-up.
The Phase 2 documentation and cleanup objectives have been achieved.
